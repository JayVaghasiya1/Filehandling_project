# Filehandling_project
Hello friends....

We going to do file handling there are two type of
file handling first one is extension wise and second one is 
catogory wise...

In this Modern time file arrangement is so boring
and time taking task to by the use of python language i
write a code to arrange files automatically.

Now we do the extension wise file handling...

first of all we need to import the required modules. so import os and
shutil module. there are inbuilt modules so don't need to install that.

First thing is that and you need to create a variabe called path 
which takes the input of the directory path that you want to organize
and then create a variable called files.

Now write a for loop condition using for loop we traverse through every
file from files then we split the filename and extension of the file
we only need an extension name so we remove the dot from the extension 
through slicing.

Then we need to write if statement if the extension directory already
exits then we move file to that directory in else statement we make a 
new directory and then we move the file into it.

let's run this program and in the end you find that all files are arrange 
in properly...

Thank you........
